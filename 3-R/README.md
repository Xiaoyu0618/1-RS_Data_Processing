# R Scripts for LiDAR Data Processing

This script computes canopy structural complexity metrics from LiDAR point clouds, combined with a vertical complexity index (VCI). It processes multiple plots/subplots, extracts height information from first and all returns, and outputs structure metrics for ecological and forest biomass modeling applications.

## Applications
- Forest canopy structure quantification  
- Plot-level monitoring in ecological observatories
